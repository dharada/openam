OpenAM Policy Agent for Nginx
=============================

# Supported Platforms

 - Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.0
 - Scientific Linux 6
 - CentOS 6

# Agent Installation

## Steps

 1. Extract nginx_EL6_agent_rXXXX.zip installation bits.

    # unzip nginx_EL6_64_agent_rXXXX.zip

 2. Goto web_agents/nginx_agent

    # cd web_agents/nginx_agent/

 3. Execute agentadmin.sh

    # ./bin/agentadmin.sh

 4. Follow the installation interactions and provide these details:

 - OpenSSO server URL
 - Agent URL
 - Agent Profile name
 - Agent Password

 5. Execute nginx

    # ./bin/nginx

# Agent Uninstallation

stop nginx and delete web_agents/nginx_agent directory.

# Nginx Configuration

agentadmin.sh aready added following configuration:

    http {
        ...
        am_boot_file "/path/to/OpenSSOAgentBootstrap.properties";
        am_conf_file "/path/to/OpenSSOAgentConfiguration.properties";

Currently I recommend one worker process because multi process mode
does not work notification from OpenAM.

Pretty soon, I'll try solving the multi process problem. However Nginx
work very well with only one process.

    worker_processes  1;

If you found some problem, then please send me the debug logfile.

    error_log logs/error.log debug_http;
