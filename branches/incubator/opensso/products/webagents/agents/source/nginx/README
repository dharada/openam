OpenAM Policy Agent for Nginx
=============================

***THIS MODULE IN THE REVIEW PHASE***

# Platforms

Currently, This module will works Linux only. I'm testing Scientific
Linux 6 and Debian Wheezy.

# Build Instructions

 1. Prepare extlib

    // TODO

 2. Build it

    $ cd products/webagents/
    $ ant nginx
    or
    $ ant nginx -Dbuild.type=64

# Configuration

Add the following line to http context in nginx.conf.
Property file is taken from another agent.

    http {
        ...
        am_boot_file "/path/to/OpenSSOAgentBootstrap.properties";
        am_conf_file "/path/to/OpenSSOAgentConfiguration.properties";

Currently I recommend one worker process because multi process mode
does not work notification from OpenAM.

Pretty soon, I'll try solving the multi process problem. However Nginx
work very well with only one process.

    worker_processes  1;

If you found some problem, then please send me the debug logfile.

    error_log  logs/error.log debug_http;

# TODO
 * build script
 * POST data handling
 * notification handling with multi processes
